# Contributing to Synthizer-python

Synthizer-python is open to pull requests for bug fixes and new features.  Please create issues
discussing new features before starting work on them, in case they need to wait, shouldn't be done, or will be more complicated than you might think.

## Licensing

This project is under the [unlicense](./LICENSE).  Please include the folllowing at the bottom of your PR comment:

```
I have read CONTRIBUTING.md, am the sole contributor to this pull request, and license my contributions under the Unlicense.
```

If there's multiple contributors to your PR, let me know in the PR.
I'll need them to all have GitHub accounts, and to leave a comment to the effect of them agreeing that their contribution is under the unlicense as well.

We might make this more formal later, but the unlicense is liberal enough to even allow relicensing, so for the time being there's no CLA.
